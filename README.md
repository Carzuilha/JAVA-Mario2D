# Mario 2D

This project shows a simple sprite that can be controlled by keyboard. You can use it to create a game or even to test a simple sprite manipulation in Java.

## About this Project

The development of this project was based on the source codes that can be viewed in https://www.javalobby.org//articles/ultimate-image/. However, there are some modifications compared to the original project:

 - In the original design, the sprite is drawn directly into a JFrame. In my project, the sprite is drawn in a JPanel, which is inserted inside the JFrame;
 - The sprite did not move around the screen, it only changed the motion animation. In this project, it moves through the screen, using the keyboard;
 - The current project was divided into an MVC (model-control-view) model to easy maintenance.
